            MD-03</a>. I spent over 2 months developing this application on the Python Django Web-Framework. The
          Homework Manager is an app for classrooms to manage homework, reminders, and announcements. Here is the video,
          which shows how this application is used. </h3>

        <h3 className="homework-text">The inspiration for my app came from the classic agenda book I
          use in school every day. I thought about what would happen if I didnâ€™t have to write down my homework
          every day, and assignments could be available online in a simplistic and organized fashion. Click <a

          I am still working on developing this application to make it better overtime, that be it at a
          slower pace. From the competition, I have made significant changes to the app by adding the ability to submit response/links. </h3>
